# AI Method 2 - Reinforcement Learning Approach

The goal of this approach was to make the Pacman agents learn policy through experience and win the game automatically by applying the policy learnt. To achieve the goal, we deployed a model-free reinforcement learning technique: approximate q-learning. A range of features were selected to describe the environment and a set of rewards were specified to encourage the right choices of actions. However, due to the inherent complexity of the problem, the features and reward used could not fully capture the states and the outcome of our initial attemp of using approximate q-learning alone was poor. Therefore, to improve the performance, we adopted a hybird approach by combining approximate q-learning with classical planning, and achieved a relatively better performance.
