# AI Method 5 - Hybrid Approach: Approximate Q-Learning & Classical Planning 

The goal of this approach was to make the Pacman agents learn policies through experience and win the game automatically by applying the learnt policies. To achieve the goal, we deployed a model-free reinforcement learning technique: approximate q-learning. A range of features were selected to describe the environment and a set of rewards were specified to encourage the right choices of actions. However, due to the inherent complexity of the problem, the features and reward used could not fully capture the states and the outcome of our initial attempt of using approximate q-learning alone was poor. Therefore, to improve the performance, we proposed a hybrid approach by combining approximate q-learning with classical planning.
